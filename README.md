# The Watch of Time
This mod simply adds a new item called the **Time Watch** which allows you to stop/resume time, thanks to minecraft's new tickrate api.

# Questions
Q: Do I need access to cheats to use the watch?\
A: The watch will work perfectly fine without cheats.

Q: Will stopping/resuming time using cheats break the Time Watch?\
A: The watch toggles based on whether time is stopped or not, so using cheats will not break the watch.

Q: Can I use your mod in my modpack?\
A: Absolutely, as long as you give credit!
